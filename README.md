QR code Generator using Python

Generate QR codes.

A standard install uses pypng to generate PNG files and can also render QR codes directly to the console. A standard install is just:

pip install qrcode
For more image functionality, install qrcode with the pil dependency so that pillow is installed and can be used for generating images:

pip install "qrcode[pil]"
